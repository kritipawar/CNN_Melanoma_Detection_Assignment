# Melanoma Detection Project

## General Information
- This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for accurately detecting melanoma.
- Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- The primary goal of this project is to create a solution that can evaluate skin images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma.
- Early detection of melanoma can significantly reduce manual effort in the diagnosis process.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- TensorFlow - version 2.5
- Keras
- Other libraries and tools used in the project.

## Conclusions
- The results from the model with dataset augmentation have shown significant improvement over previous models, achieving a training accuracy of 0.94 at 20 epochs and a validation accuracy of 0.84. However, there are indications of overfitting, as seen by the large fluctuations in the validation loss. To address this issue, we can implement a learning rate scheduler to reduce the learning rate when an accuracy of 0.8 is reached, which may lead to further improvements.
