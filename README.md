# Melanoma Detection Project

## General Information
- This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for accurately detecting melanoma.
- Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- The primary goal of this project is to create a solution that can evaluate skin images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma.
- Early detection of melanoma can significantly reduce manual effort in the diagnosis process.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- TensorFlow - version 2.5
- Keras
- Other libraries and tools used in the project.

## Conclusions
- The model achieved an accuracy of  in melanoma detection.
- The CNN architecture used proved to be effective in classifying skin images.
- The model can be a valuable tool in assisting dermatologists with early melanoma detection.
- Future improvements and enhancements can be considered to make the model even more accurate and efficient.
